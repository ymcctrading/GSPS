## Product Roadmap

`ROADMAP.md` is the governing roadmap for this project. **Read it before
proposing new work, scoping a feature, or prioritizing between options** — it
decides what gets built and in what order, and it outranks `BACKLOG.md`, which
is an unscheduled idea pool rather than a set of commitments.

**Work out the current phase from today's date against this table** — don't
assume Q1:

| Phase | Window | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Aug–Oct 2026 | Monetization & retention foundation |
| Q2 | Nov 2026 – Jan 2027 | Differentiation & scale foundation |
| Q3 | Feb–Apr 2027 | Mobile & community |
| Q4 | May–Jul 2027 | Enterprise & scale |

Then open `ROADMAP.md` for that phase's goals, initiatives, and dependencies.
If today's date is past Jul 2027, the roadmap is expired — say so rather than
defaulting to the last phase.

- When suggesting work, name the phase it belongs to. If it fits no phase, say
  so plainly — it is either out of scope or a reason to amend the roadmap.
- Out-of-phase work is fine when there's a reason (production bug, security
  issue, blocked dependency, or a direct request). Note the deviation rather
  than presenting it as planned.
- When a change invalidates part of the roadmap, update `ROADMAP.md` in the
  same PR and move its "Last updated" date.

## Deployment (Vercel)

- The project runs on the **Vercel Hobby (free) plan**. Cron jobs are capped at **2 per project**, each running **no more than once a day**. Before adding a new scheduled job, confirm the total stays at or under that cap — see `docs/THIRD_PARTY_LIMITS.md`. If something needs to run more often than daily, it does not belong in `vercel.json` crons; trigger it from an external scheduler instead.
- `vercel.json` sets `"git": {"deploymentEnabled": true}`, so Git-triggered deployments are **on**: pushing a branch builds a preview, and **merging to `main` deploys straight to production**. There is no manual gate in between. Treat a merge as a release: it is live for users within a couple of minutes.
- **Never trigger a Vercel deployment unless explicitly asked.** The user will say which environment — preview or production — when they want one. Don't assume. Because merges auto-deploy, this also means **don't merge to `main` unless asked** — merging is deploying.
- A branch push unavoidably spawns a preview build. That is expected and fine when you are pushing real work; don't push no-op commits just to move a pointer.

## Git / PR Workflow

- After pushing commits that contain code changes, **always open a pull request** against `main` rather than stopping at the push. Check for a PR template first.
- Do work on the designated feature branch for the task; don't commit directly to `main`.
