/**
 * "Freeze a strategy version before shadow/live-paper tracking" — the
 * Validation, Backtesting, Audit & Compliance spec pack's requirement that a
 * performance claim be tied to the exact rule set that produced it, not to
 * "whatever the code does today".
 *
 * This is a manually bumped identifier, not a hash of the scoring modules:
 * a hash would change on any refactor that touches those files even when no
 * rule changed, which is noise this is meant to avoid. Bump it deliberately
 * whenever a change lands that could move backtest results — the same set
 * `docs/BACKTESTING.md`'s "So what does move the numbers" section lists
 * (`lib/scoring/score.ts`, `lib/scoring/proximity.ts`, `lib/scoring/weights.ts`,
 * `lib/strat/patterns.ts`, `lib/strat/levels.ts`, the Signal and Regime Engine
 * states) — and note the bump in `CHANGELOG.md`.

// 2026-09-27: Gann's own swing charts (3-Day Chart and 7-day weekly chart on
// highs and lows, trend turns on breaking the last swing extreme) replace the
// close-count 3/9 charts under swingChartTrend, the regime engine, readTrend
// and the entry trigger's pivots. Conflict X3, owner decision.
// Same day, second bump: Gann's change-of-trend rules in the trend read
// (over-balance of space/time, monthly-low break), his fractions of the year
// and day-count bands in the time windows, his major percentage-of-price
// levels in the S/R list, and the Rule of Three scored on weekly and monthly
// closes as well as daily.
// Third bump (owner decision 5): Gann's breakaway rule. A range-bound setup
// whose entry stays inside its 13-week range is held from Execute to Watch.
// Fourth bump (parity C4 and D1): equity TP1/master taken from Gann and S/R
// levels, and the volume criterion reads Gann's full rule (drying-up bottoms,
// lower-volume retests, the climax as the panic exception).
// 2026-09-28 (owner): Gann's even figures move equity stops beyond, and add
// targets just short of, round numbers (lib/gann/evenFigures.ts via
// computeEquityTradeLevels); live and paper exits switch to Gann's rules with
// 60% at TP1 (replay exitRule "gann-runner"). The ⅓ and ⅔ seasonal dates join
// the fixed calendar. New context readings are measured, not scored.
// Same day, second bump: Gann's "3 points" in the exit rules is price-scaled
// from his own bands (lib/gann/pointScale.ts) instead of the entry's 0.3%
// lost-motion margin; the STRAT shape no longer gates publication or the
// continuation pass (Gann's with-the-daily-trend rule, isGannContinuation);
// the replay's pyramid adds now fire; macro/decade cycles read as of the bar.
// Third bump: Gann's three-adverse-closes exit reads the first three sessions
// from the fill, as the source counts them, not any three closes in the trade.
// 2026-09-30 (owner): a breached stop retires the plan until a later scan
// confirms or replaces it (lib/gann/stopBreach.ts). The live scan holds a plan
// whose stop the price is through to Reject; the replay does not enter a plan
// whose stop an earlier candle of the session traded through.
